1. Odd or even
   Welcome a user then ask them for a number between 1 and 1000.
   When the user gives you the number, you check if it's odd or even and then
    you print a message letting them know.

2. Mad libs game
   Ask the user for an input.
   This could be anything such as a name, an adjective, a pronoun or even an action. 
    Once you get the input, you can rearrange it to build up your own story.

3. Word count
   Ask the user what's on their mind. Then after the user responds, 
    count the number of words in the sentence and print that as an output.
